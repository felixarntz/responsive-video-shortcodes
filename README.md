Current News on oEmbed
----------------------
WordPress uses [oEmbed](http://oembed.com/) to embed external media. As of Version 1.1.5, Responsive Video Shortcodes includes an autoplay attribute for the short code. However, as far as I found out, only Vimeo and Soundcloud support autoplays using oEmbed, and still they have different names for the argument. If you find out that another of the WordPress-supported oEmbed platforms supports autoplay, it would be nice if you let me know.

Currently the only services supporting autoplay with oEmbed are:
* [Vimeo](https://developer.vimeo.com/apis/oembed)
* [Soundcloud](http://developers.soundcloud.com/docs/oembed)
