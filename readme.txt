This tiny Plugin allows you to embed Online Video from YouTube, Vimeo and more for a responsive Layout - they scale according to the screen size.

== Description ==

Responsive Video Shortcodes is a tiny Plugin that allows you to embed video files from the popular video hosting platforms in a responsive design. It is based on the Wordpress oEmbed Feature, so it supports every online service that is natively supported by Wordpress. All you need to do is use the shortcode and put a video URL in the content between the tags. Alternatively, you can use a widget to display a (responsive) list of videos.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the entire `responsive-video` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Use the shortcode or the widget - or both.

You will find a 'Responsive Video' menu in your WordPress settings. There are no settings to configure, so it contains a detailed tutorial on how to use the shortcode.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is the name of the shortcode? =

You got to use the enclosing [video] shortcode.

= How do I use the shortcode? =

You find a detailed description in the 'Responsive Video' menu in your WordPress settings.

= Why aren't my videos shown in the widget? =
